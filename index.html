            "After expanding rapidly for years and snapping up assets as China’s economy boomed, <strong>Evergrande is now snowed under a crushing debt of $300 billion</strong>. </br> 
            The world’s most indebted property developer has been scrambling to pay its suppliers, and warned investors twice in as many weeks that <strong>it could default on its debts</strong>. </br>
